    HomePage now uses FlowPart for page sections.
    Each section widget (HeroBannerWidget, ServicesSectionWidget, etc.)
    is rendered via its Widget-{ContentType}.cshtml shape override.

    The admin can:
    - Add sections via "Add Widget" in the FlowPart editor
    - Reorder sections by drag-and-drop
    - Remove sections as needed
    - Each section is self-contained with its own title/subtitle and embedded items
